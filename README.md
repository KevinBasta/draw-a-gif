# draw-a-gif

A React front-end for my [gif encoder written in c](https://github.com/KevinBasta/GIF-Encoder). This web app allows you to draw a series of images on a canvas and convert them into a gif. As a result of using my gif encoder, there are many options/features available that leverage the gif file format specification fully.

## Features:
- Flexible frames: reorder, duplicate, and delete frames 
- File format options: change the duration of each frame and the type of gif transition between frames
- Reactive colours: change a colour in the colour pallet and it will result in all frames using that colour to also change
- Quality Enhancement: enlarge gifs with a width/height multiplier
- Storage: save web app gif data to local storage
- Backup: download web app gif JSON save files
- Collaborate: upload web app gif JSON save files to continue editing
